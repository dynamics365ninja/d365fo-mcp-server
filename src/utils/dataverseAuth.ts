/**
 * Azure AD sign-in for calls to a Dataverse environment's Web API.
 *
 * Used on UDE, where the D365FO runtime is hosted in the cloud and reached through the
 * Dataverse environment it belongs to (run_systest_class sends tests there). It signs in as
 * the developer, interactively, through a public client — the same kind of sign-in Visual
 * Studio's Power Platform Tools and `pac` do — so the calls run with the developer's own
 * Dataverse permissions and need no secret in the configuration.
 *
 * Tokens are cached in memory only, so a server process asks for one sign-in and renews it
 * silently after that. At most one browser sign-in per client is in progress at a time.
 * Tokens are never logged or returned to the caller's transcript.
 *
 * Because nothing is written to disk, the first call in every new server process (typically
 * every new MCP client session) opens the browser. When the developer is still signed in to
 * Microsoft, the page completes on its own and only says "Signed in", leaving a tab to close.
 * Avoiding it would need a persistent token cache: an msal-node ICachePlugin that keeps the
 * cache in a file encrypted for the current user (DPAPI on Windows, as az CLI and `pac` do),
 * so that a new process would renew silently from the stored refresh token. msal-node's own
 * persistence (@azure/msal-node-extensions) brings native add-ons this server does not
 * otherwise need.
